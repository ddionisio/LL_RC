    "intro_1": "Welcome to Super Gnomatic Rock Cycler!",
    "intro_2": "We'll be learning about the various processes of forming rocks.",
    "intro_3": "Rocks are made up of minerals.",
    "intro_4": "Depending on the minerals and how it was formed, a rock can have distinct characteristics.",
    "intro_5": "We'll look into more details on the different types of rocks later.",
    "intro_6": "For now, let's go ahead and gather some minerals!",

    "intro_enter_magma_1": "Now that you have some minerals, it's time to melt them down into magma.",
    "intro_enter_magma_2": "Head over to the Magma Chamber to do so.",
    "intro_magma_chamber_1": "On Earth, rocks are continuously pushed upward or downward due to powerful forces such as an earthquake.",
    "intro_magma_chamber_2": "Rocks pushed deep into the mantle's hot spots will melt to magma.",
    "intro_magma_chamber_3": "Here in the Magma Chamber, we simulate the process of melting rocks to magma.",
    "intro_magma_chamber_4": "Go ahead and process the minerals by holding the Spacebar (you can also click and hold the icon).",
    "intro_enter_magma_cooler_1": "Now that we have magma available, it's time to form some rocks!",
    "intro_enter_magma_cooler_2": "If you notice at the very top, we need to form at least three different types of igneous rocks.",
    "intro_enter_magma_cooler_3": "In order to form igneous rocks, head over to the Magma Cooler.",
    "intro_intrusive_igneous_1": "There are two ways for igneous rocks to form: intrusive or extrusive.",
    "intro_intrusive_igneous_2": "For now, we will form intrusive igneous rocks.",
    "intro_intrusive_igneous_3": "Intrusive igneous rocks are formed when magma cools off below the Earth’s surface.",
    "intro_intrusive_igneous_4": "Try to form three different types of rocks based on how long the magma cools.",
    "intrusive_igneous_instruction": "Press the Spacebar (or click STOP) to end the cooling process.",
    "submit_instruction_1": "Now that you have formed the necessary rocks, it’s time to drop them off.",
    "submit_instruction_2": "Head over to the indicated star and submit the rocks!",
    "next_adventure_dialog_1": "Excellent work! Now that the rocks have been submitted, we can gather more minerals to form new rocks.",
    "intro_enter_magma_cooler_extrusive_1": "Just like before, we need to form three different types of igneous rocks.",
    "intro_enter_magma_cooler_extrusive_2": "Remember to melt the minerals in the Magma Chamber, and then form the rocks in the Magma Cooler.",
    "intro_extrusive_igneous_1": "This time around, we'll be forming extrusive igneous rocks.",
    "intro_extrusive_igneous_2": "These rocks are formed when magma cools off above the Earth's surface. For example: when a volcano erupts.",
    "intro_extrusive_igneous_3": "Since these rocks cool off quicker, they don't form as much crystals as intrusive igneous rocks.",
    "intro_enter_sedimentary_1": "For sedimentary rocks to be formed, we must first have rocks available to break down into sediments.",
    "intro_enter_sedimentary_2": "Go ahead and create some igneous rocks before heading over to the Sedimentary Pit.",
    "intro_sedimentary_1": "Sedimentary rocks form when sediments cement together after a long period of time.",
    "intro_sedimentary_2": "These sediments come from any type of rocks, or certain organics that have been broken down by weathering and erosion.",
    "intro_sedimentary_3": "Here in the Sedimentary Pit, we will be simulating the process of breaking down rocks into sediments, and then cementing it to form a new rock.",
    "intro_sedimentary_4": "The result of the sedimentary rock will be based on the grain size of the sediments. So, make sure to try out different sizes!",
    "intro_enter_sedimentary_organic_1": "This time around, we will be making sedimentary rocks with organic materials.",
    "intro_enter_sedimentary_organic_2": "Head directly to the Sedimentary Pit.",
    "intro_sedimentary_organic_1": "Sedimentary rocks can be formed from the remains of certain life-forms.",
    "intro_sedimentary_organic_2": "For example, plants and trees that were buried for millions of years can turn into coal.",
    "intro_sedimentary_organic_3": "If you’re lucky, you can find a fossil or two from these kinds of rocks.",
    "intro_enter_metamorph_1": "For our final rock type: Metamorphic, we’re going to first need to form other rocks.",
    "intro_enter_metamorph_2": "Once you have a bunch of rocks available, head over to the Metamorphic Pit.",
    "intro_metamorph_1": "When a rock is subjected to enough heat and/or pressure, its form will change drastically, morphing into a whole different rock.",
    "intro_metamorph_2": "Depending on the type of rock you choose, the result will be different.",
    "intro_metamorph_3": "Try to morph a previously morphed rock to get another type of rock.",
    "end_dialog_1": "Congratulations! You have gathered all the rocks that we need!",
